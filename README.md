# Calculator

### Explanations of the technologies used

I created a simple calculator. I used javascript to create the functionality. CSS was used to give it its style.

### Approach taken

I started off by figureing out what I needed for a calculator to be a calculator. So I looked up images on google. Once I had that I decided to work on the html to get the structure. After that I started on the javascript. I realized that I would need separate functions for each calculator function(addiction, subtraction etc). Once i had that i could work on styling it with CSS.
